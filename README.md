**^ The Juggler ^**

## Notes

 - Provision entire labs of networked virtual machines and containers and automate the installation of the OS on the VMs.
 - Use python bindings for libvirt to deal with virtual machines.
 - Use python bindings for podman to deal with containers.
 - Use flask for a web management interface.
